# What we'll talk about

1. Intro, housekeeping
1. Workshop content (theory)
    1. `Filter`: HTTP building block
    1. `Authentication`: domain language
    1. `AuthenticationProvider`: easier authentication
    1. `Configurers`: how things are wired together
    1. Overloading existing behavior
    1. Authorization

> ### I have a complex scenario. What could be wrong?

> You need an understanding of the technologies you intend to use before you can successfully build

> login form and some hard-coded users with Spring Security‚Äôs namespace is reasonably
> straightforward. Moving to using a backed JDBC database is also easy enough. However, if you try
> to jump straight to a complicated deployment scenario like [this example scenario], you are almost

> such as CAS, configure LDAP servers, and install SSL certificates properly. So you need to take
> things one step at a time.

# What we won't talk about

- Reactive
    - Focus on Servlet
- Testing
- Not much about Authorization
    - Focus on Authentication

---
layout: default
---

# What you'll need

- Basic knowledge of Spring and Spring Boot
  - Familiarity with Spring Security is not expected, but is a plus
- Java 17+ ; consider using [SDKman](https://sdkman.io/) to install new versions of Java
- An HTTP client, such as `curl`, `httpie`, `Postman`, ...
- Docker, for an OpenID (SSO) provider

---

# How we'll work

- 7 self-guided modules
- Between each module
    - Debrief
    - Introduce theory for the next module

# Spring Security Filters

```java
public void doFilter(
  HttpServletRequest request, 
  HttpServletResponse response, 
  FilterChain chain
  ) {
    // 1. Before the request proceeds further (e.g. authentication or reject req)
    // ...

    // 2. Invoke the "rest" of the chain
    chain.doFilter(request, response);

    // 3. Once the request has been fully processed (e.g. cleanup)
    // ...
}

## _Module 2_

# Writing your first filter


---
layout: default
---

# _Module 2_ debrief

1. Create a `Filter`
    1. Takes HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse in
    2. Reads from request, (sometimes) writes to Response
    3. Sometimes does nothing!
2. Register the `Filter` in the `SecurityFilterChain`
    1. _Before_ `AuthorizationFilter.class`
    2. Or any other filter you know.

---

# Discovering Filters

- `DefaultSecurityFilterChain`
- `FilterChainProxy`
- Logs

# Authentication

Knowing the user...

---

# Authentication objects

##

Spring Security produces `Authentication`. They are used for:
- Authentication (`authn`): _who_ is the user?
- Authorization (`authz`): is the user _allowed to perform_ XYZ?

---

# Vocabulary

- **Authentication**: represents the user. Contains:
  - **Principal**: user "identity" (name, email...)
  - **GrantedAuthorities**: "permissions" (`roles`, ...)

```text
More details in the reference docs:

> Servlet Applications
    > Authentication
        > Architecture
```

---

# Vocabulary (cont')

- **Authentication** also contains:
  - **.isAuthenticated()**: almost always `true`
  - **details**: details about the _request_
  - (Credentials): "password", often `null`

```text
More details in the reference docs:

> Servlet Applications
    > Authentication
        > Architecture
```

---

# For your own apps

##

**DO NOT**

Use `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` everywhere

<br>

**INSTEAD**

Create your own `Authentication` subclasses

---

# Wrapped in a SecurityContext

- The core class is `SecurityContextHolder`
- `public static SecurityContext getContext()`
- Thread-local, not propagated to child threads
- Cleared after requests is 100% processed

Note: there is also a `SecurityContextHolderStrategy`

---

# Remember our filter?

```java
public void doFilter(
  HttpServletRequest request, 
  HttpServletResponse response, 
  FilterChain chain
  ) {
    // 1. Before the request proceeds further (e.g. authentication or reject req)
    // ...

    // 2. Invoke the "rest" of the chain
    chain.doFilter(request, response);

    // 3. Once the request has been fully processed (e.g. cleanup)
    // ...
}
```

---

# More like this

```java
public void doFilter(
  HttpServletRequest request, 
  HttpServletResponse response, 
  FilterChain chain
  ) {
    // 1. Decide whether the filter should be applied

    // 2. Apply filter: authenticate or reject request

    // 3. Invoke the "rest" of the chain
    chain.doFilter(request, response);

    // 4. No cleanup
}
```

## _Module 3_

# Custom authentication

---

# _Module 3_ debrief

##

Some filters produce an `Authentication`

1. Read the request ("convert" to domain object)
2. Authenticate (are the credentials valid?)
3. Save the `Authentication` in the `SecurityContext`
4. Or reject the request when creds invalid

---

# Saving SecurityContext between requests

##

By default, the security context is only valid for the current request.

To re-use your authentication accross requests, use `HttpSessionSecurityContextRepository`.

## `AuthenticationProvider`

## Authentication

About those `Authentication`s... I may have oversimplified a bit.

## _Module 4_

<br>

## `AuthenticationProvider`

---

# _Module 4_ debrief

1. `Authentication`s are a sets of credentials for authentication AND the
output of successful authentication.
2. Transforming credentials into authentication happens in `AuthenticationProviders`
3. That's where you should create your own authentication rules

- Avoid copy-paste at all cost!
    - Extend or delegate instead

## _Module 7_
