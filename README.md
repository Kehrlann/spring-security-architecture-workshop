# Spring Security: The Good Parts workshop

This workshop aims to demystify how Spring Security works, show you what concepts it uses under the
hood, and give you keys for fitting your own use-cases.

## Pre-requisites

- Basic knowledge of Spring and Spring Boot
  - Familiarity with Spring Security is not expected, but is a plus
- Java 17+ ; consider using [SDKman](https://sdkman.io/) to install new versions of Java
- An HTTP client, such as `curl`, `httpie`, `Postman`, ...
- Docker, for an OpenID (SSO) provider

## Structure

This workshop is composed of multiple modules. Each module has instructions, and a self-contained
project, that can be run independently from other modules.

Each module will have prompts in the various sections. Each prompt will have a solution, marked with
the ðŸ“– emoji. You can click on the line to expand it.

Try and answer questions by looking at the docs first, rather than looking up the solution
immediately!

## Modules

1. Adding Spring Security to an existing project
2. Implementing your first filter
